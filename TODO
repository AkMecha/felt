Due to our own lack of experience/hardware/software, we definitely need
volunteers (we'd be willing to help where we could of course) for this stuff:

	o load combinations
	o some sort of velvet-like interface for Windows
	o all of the above kinds of things (particularly just binaries of the
          command-line applications) for the Mac.

Things that maybe we'll get to someday, but if you want to try them first
then please feel free.  In no particular order:

	o make use of the Layout widget for geometry management of the main GUI
	o more intelligent use of the command line ... command completion
	  and argument specification ... type node hit space,
  	  get a "list of options" type delete hit space, get a prompt
	  for a number, type number hit return, etc.  In other
	  words make it something along the lines of some of the
	  popular CAD systems.
 	o improve plotting of displaced shapes. This probably means that
	  element writers need to provide a pointer to a function which
	  knows about the shape functions for an element and can fill in
	  a vector over the area or length of the element based on 
	  nodal displacements which, when plotted, will reflect the true
	  displaced shape of the element ...  
	o add snap to tool capability
	o robust quadrilateral mesh generation, 3-d mesh generation, etc, etc.
	o additional higher-order elements -- particularly an LST and maybe
	  a quadratic 6-node axisymm element.  The current linear axisymm
          element could also be made more accurate given an actual
          stiffness integration scheme.  These last would all be fairly easy.
	o fold Timoshenko beam theory into the standard beam, i.e., if
	  kappa or nu is given then expect a G and use Timoshenko
	  theory instead of Euler-Bernoulli.
	o put some real effort into internationalization.  The current 
	  functionality is there because it was easy.  More robust
	  implementation would mean maintaining a table, in code probably,
	  that mapped all possible input and as much output as possible
	  to a language determined by the user.
        o plug in something more universal than PPM to replace GIF - 
          PNG probably? 
        o fix the object apply code in velvet so that when an object
          gets applied to a node or element its color changes as appropriate
          (rather than waiting for a recolor request from the color
          control dialog).
        o an OpenGL 3D stress viewer
        o consolidation of much of the isoparametric code: brick, CST, LST,
          quad, axisymm. 
        o uniform stresses, nodally averaged stresses as appropriate,
          principle stresses, von Mises stress
        o von Mises precision calculation
        o better, more uniform handling of distributed loads
        o better handling of thermal analysis for the two elements that
	  we currently have, convection over the ctg surface for example,
          rather than just the end
