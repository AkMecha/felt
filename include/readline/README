This directory contains the include files for the readline-2.0 library, which
is available from prep.ai.mit.edu in /pub/gnu.  They seem to fall under
Version 1 of the GNU General Public License, which is also included here.  We
have included these files here since they tend not to get installed properly.
Even though your system has libreadline.a, it may have been installed due to
bash, gcc, or gdb, which seem to fail to install the include files.  Even an
installation of the readline library itself fails to install the include
files properly.  The library, at least as we have it, has apparently not been
updated in quite some time, which may account for its faults and old license.

The readline library is only needed for burlap, the element prototyping
environment, which itself is still a prototype.  Burlap will compile fine
without the readline library, but command line editing and history will not
be available from within burlap.  To use the readline library with burlap,
which is recommended, Makefile.conf should have READLINE defined to be
-DREADLINE and READLIBS should be defined to be the location of the required
libraries, which usually include liberty.a and either libtermcap.a or
libcurses.a in addition to libreadline.a, including and flags to indicate the
directory.  For example:

READLINE=-DREADLINE
READLIBS=-L/usr/gnu/lib -lreadline -ltermcap -liberty
