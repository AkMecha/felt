This is the README file for version 3.02 of FElt  - a package for
introductory level finite element analysis.

See the file README.old for a basic descriptions of previous versions of FElt
and what it's all about.  See the file CHANGELOG for a detailed list of
what's new/fixed in this release.  This is basically an interim bug
fix release - there are lots of new features but for the most part
they are only partially implemented ... The list of frequently asked 
questions (and their answers) is in FAQ (which has not been updated
for this release).  The documentation (felt-3.02.ps.gz) has also
only been marginally updated.  It now includes an (incomplete)
chapter describing the operation of WinFElt.

For installation instructions see the file INSTALL.  The best way to get a
feel for the package is to use it.  Several examples are provided in the
examples/ directory.    Nonlinear, loadcase and load range examples
include truss_nl.flt beam_lr.flt, beam_lc.flt, etc.

As usual, we would like to stress that feedback is always appreciated ... we
welcome all comments as to usability and functionality.  If you're using the
package please drop us a note and let us know what you think, even if you've
got no complaints whatsoever.  Mail bug reports, comments, hints, suggestion,
complaints, etc. to one of us at the email addresses below.
