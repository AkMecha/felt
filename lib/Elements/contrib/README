The elements defined by the source files in this directory are not supported
by the authors of FElt.  We just collect them from people who have written
them and make them available as part of the standard distribution as a
convenience to you the user who might find them useful.  For details on
any of them I strongly recommend that you simply take a look at the source
code and associated comments.  These elements will be included in the
standard element library during the default build process.  If you do not
want them included edit the Makefile in lib/Elements and set the CONTRIB =
line to nothing (i.e., make it empty).
