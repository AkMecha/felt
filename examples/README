Lots of the examples are from D.L. Logan's book, "A first course in the
finite element method," 2nd edition, PWS-Kent Publishing Company, 1992.
We make no claims on their copyright obviously - we just use them for 
numerical testing purposes.

Others might be from people that have sent us bugs and we just thought they
looked cool.  Hope this doesn't offend anybody - we rather doubt that there
is anything proprietary, top secret or truly innovative about any of these ...
