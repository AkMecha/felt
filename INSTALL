This is the INSTALL file for the version 3.x of FElt.  There have been
considerable changes since version 2.x, so please read this file.

If you have a binary release:

    The default installation prefix is /usr/local.  Executables will
    go into /usr/local/bin, manual pages into /usr/local/man, and the
    remaining files into /usr/local/lib/felt.

    If you want to change the installation prefix then you need to do
    a "./configure --prefix=dir", where "dir" is your prefix.  You may
    also wish to edit ./etc/Makefile.conf to change the individual
    installation directories.

    Once the installation directories are set, all you need to do is a
    "make install" to perform the installation.  Any necessary
    directories will be created.


If you are building from source:

    First, read the README files.

    You will need a C compiler and X11R5 or X11R6, including the
    Athena widget set, to compile FElt.  FElt will also compile under
    X11R4 under certain architectures, most notably SGI.

    If you have gcc, we *strongly* recommend using it.  If you don't
    have gcc then you may get all sorts of weird compile-time errors
    about prototypes and include files.  Any warnings can probably be
    ignored.  FElt should compile with the various native Sun
    compilers.  Our experiences with overcoming several problems of
    SGIs are included at the end of this file.

    To configure FElt, do a "./configure" from the root of the
    hierarchy.  On some systems, you may need to do a "sh configure".
    The configure script should produce a list of defaults for your
    system and create the ./etc/Makefile.conf file, which contains all
    of the system specific information.  You can do a "./configure
    --help" to find out how to pass options to the configure script.
    You may also edit the ./etc/Makefile.conf file by hand.

    The geompack library used for element generation is written in
    Fortran, but C versions as converted by f2c are provided.  Using a
    native Fortran compiler is recommended since it will probably
    outperform the corresponding C code, but unfortunately,
    determining what your specific Fortran libraries are is not a
    simple process so unless you know exactly what you are doing it's
    not worth bothering with.  You don't need to have the f2c
    libraries to use the converted code.  If you want to use native
    Fortran on HP-UX, then there are some hints for you in the special
    section on HP-UX at the end of this file.

    You can now do a "make" or a "make all" to build the entire package.
    The various targets are:

    make all
	builds all executables and libraries

    make clean
	removes all executables, libraries, and object files

    make clobber
	same as a make clean, but also removes other files that can be
	regenerated if you have the correct versions of flex and bison

    make install
	installs the executables, manual pages, and defaults files

    make depend
	at present, does nothing

    make test
	performs a simple test comparing the output from felt on
	./etc/Tests/mixed_dist.felt with the known answers; the
	answers may vary slightly due to floating point round-off
	(available only from the root directory)

    The entire package has been compiled and tested under SunOS (using
    gcc and Sun's native compilers) and Linux (1.0 and 1.1 kernels).
    Earlier releases compiled and ran on SystemV386 (R3.2.2 using
    gcc), various SGI machines, HP-UX 8.0 and 9.0 (using HP's cc and
    gcc), and DEC (using both OSF/1 and Ultrix) and IBM (AIX)
    workstations.  There is no reason this one shouldn't do the same.

    We personally prefer the 3D Athena widget set; if it's available
    on your system and you want to use it, the only thing that we
    recommend that you change are the application defaults ... simply
    uncomment the 3D stuff in the file Velvet.ad in the ./src/Velvet
    directory (and comment the 2D stuff).

    Additional information about building and administering FElt is
    available in Appendix A of the User's Guide and Reference manual
    (available separately).  You'll definitely want to read this if
    you plan on installing and actively using the system.


---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Special notes for SGI users:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Ok, we don't recommend it, but we have had some success at building
FElt on Irix 4.0.x with the native compiler (and X11R4, which I
believe is the standard X that is included with 4.0.x).  This is the
kind of thing where your mileage will definitely vary - we don't
really have a lot of experience with Irix and have no clue as to how
consistent this will be across different versions and installations.

In FElt-3.xx/lib/Felt/lexer.c you need to comment out the prototypes for
malloc and free.  There are two places where definitions occur, you need
to change the one like:

char *malloc();
int free();

to look like:

/* char *malloc();
int free() ; */

Next, copy /usr/include/stdlib.h to FElt-3.xx/include.  In the copied
file (FElt-3.xx/include/stdlib.h), comment out the line that looks like

extern int	system(const char *);

It's probably somewhere around line 102, it should now look like

/* extern int	system(const char *); */

Special notes for HPUX 9.0x, 700 series
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you want to use the native Fortran compiler then from the toplevel
FElt directory, do 

rm -f ./lib/Geompack/*.c

and add the following variables to ./etc/Makefile.conf

FC      = fort77
FCOPTS  = -O
